            <li>  Discrete mathematics & Graph theory</li>
             <li> Algorithm analyisis & Clean programming</li>
         </ul>
         After completing my bachelors in computer science, I went on to complete my masters in <b>information
         Security</b> due to my passion in computer security. Bitcoin got my attention due to its implementation to achieve decentralized money.
         Involved in cryptocurrency trading initially. Soon gained interest in the the cryptocurrency and the underlying technology and spent most of the
         time exploring this technology. Currently I'm exploring blockchain technology and writing a book titled

         <h3> Professional life </h3>

         <p>
             <ul>
             <li>I started working for a security firm during and after completing my masters. I worked closely in the DevOps team for over a year there.
                 RSA gave me a lot of exposure to the security industry.
             </li>
               <li> Later, I started working as a senior software engineer in a startup called CoWrks where I gained a lot of exposure as
             a fullstack developer and managing the team.
               </li>
         <li>
             After CoWrks, I devoted full time to research on blockchain and write book after taking break from professional life.
